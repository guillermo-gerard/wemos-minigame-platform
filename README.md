# wemos-minigame-platform

A PoC with a esp8266-based Wemos D1 mini and a small 128x64px OLED display. It can be used as a base for the development of a simple game console.
There are only a game included, a clon of the famous Arkanoid. Without the bricks, though :) 
If you want to write another game, you can do so by implementing the IGame interface
